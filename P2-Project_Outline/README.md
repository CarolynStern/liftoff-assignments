## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For my project, I am wanting to create a cocktail database for users to sign in and search through cocktails either by ingredient or name. I also want to create the capability for users to add their own cocktails to this database as well as create lists of cocktails to store on their page. These lists can be their favorites, cocktails to try, and also cocktails they have added to the database. Eventually I would like to make it interactive so that users can search for other users and see each others added cocktails, view their lists, follow their page and connect with each other. 
### Features
user login: each user will be able to create an account and sign in and have a profile page
search: users will be able to search either by ingredient or name
add: users will be able to add their own cocktails to the database
lists: users can add cocktails to lists that can be viewed on their profile
search by user: users will be able to search and add other users in order to see their lists and cocktails 
### Technologies
java, mySQL, spring boot, thymeleaf, bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need a better understanding of MySQL in order to have a working database that stores classic cocktails from the beginning. I will also need to learn how to test for errors when it comes to allowing users to add cocktails in order to make sure that only legitimate recipes are being added.
